A simple, fun API that gives you a random excuse to procrastinate. Because sometimes you just need a reason to put things off until tomorrow.

---

## ü§î What is it?

This is a lightweight, serverless API built with Go and designed for deployment on Vercel. It reads from a list of classic procrastination excuses and returns a random one every time you call it.

## üöÄ Usage

To get your random excuse, simply send a `GET` request to the API endpoint.

**Endpoint:** `/api/reason`

### Example Request

You can use `curl` or any HTTP client to make a request.

```bash
curl https://procrastinate-api.vercel.app/api/reason
```

### Example Response

The API will return a random reason as a plain text response.

```
You work better under pressure anyway.
```

Or maybe...

```
You should probably clean your entire house before you start.
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Running Locally

To run this project locally, you can use the Vercel CLI, which will replicate the serverless environment.

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/andrinoff/procrastinate-api.git](https://github.com/andrinoff/procrastinate-api.git)
    cd procrastinate-api
    ```

2. **Install Vercel CLI:**

    ```bash
    npm i -g vercel
    ```

3. **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    vercel dev
    ```

The local server will start, and you can access the API at an address like `http://localhost:3000/api/reason`.
